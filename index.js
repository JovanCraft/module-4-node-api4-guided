//console.log(process.argv)//this shows an array consisting of the node path, the actual path, and whatever arguments you pass into the terminal. EX: node index.js foo bar baz
//const foo = process.argv[2]
//foo is number 3 in the array!
//console.log(foo)

//typing env into the terminal shows you a list on environment variables
//console.log(process.env)//you would use this to get access to the environment variables
//console.log(process.env.USER)//to get access to the USER variable inside the environment variables()says jovan which is me ðŸ˜‰
